# Question 3
# Given an undirected graph G, find the minimum spanning tree within G.
# A minimum spanning tree connects all vertices in a graph with the smallest possible total weight of edges.
# Your function should take in and return an adjacency list structured like this:
#
# {'A': [('B', 2)],
#  'B': [('A', 2), ('C', 5)],
#  'C': [('B', 5)]}
# Vertices are represented as unique strings. The function definition should be question3(G)
