# Question 1
# Given two strings s and t, determine whether some anagram of t is a substring of s. 
# For example: if s = "udacity" and t = "ad", then the function returns True. 
# Your function definition should look like: question1(s, t) and return a boolean True or False.
# 

def question1(s,t):
  pass

# Test code
question("udacity", "ad")
